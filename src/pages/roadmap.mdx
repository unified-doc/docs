## Roadmap
Intiatives and projects planned in the future:

- Finish this site!
- Implement `unified-doc-parse-csv` to parse CSV as HTML tables.
- Work on unofficial `docx` and `pdf` parsers until the `unified` ecosystem ships formal parsers for the corresponding syntax trees.
- Spec the `.uni` content type (`text/uni` mime type) with the `unified` community.
- Work on `unified-doc-cli` that exposes `unified-doc` APIS conveniently in the CLI.
