<SourceCode source="examples/diff" />

Interactively compare two contents and view their diffed parts with `unified-doc`.  This example preloads equivalent HTML and markdown content.  Notice just how markdown closely resembles HTML!

### Concepts
- Dynamically compute marks and construct a new doc.
- Apply custom CSS
- `options.marks`
- `options.sanitizeSchema`
