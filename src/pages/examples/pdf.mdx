> This is an experimental example.  The implementation and features are subject to change.

This example uses [`pdf.js`][pdfjs] to convert PDF documents into HTML documents containing images and text nodes.  With the PDF document represented by a collection of HTML documents, we can benefit from all `unified-doc` APIs (e.g. render, search, export, marks etc).

The management of a collection of `doc` instances with basic pagination support is done through the [`unified-doc-archive`][unified-doc-archive] library.

### Features
- Features from the <Link to="/examples/doc-preview">Doc preview</Link> example apply here.
- Upload and preview any PDF file using the `DocPreview` component.
- Pagination support.

### Concepts
- Most concepts from the <Link to="/examples/doc-preview">Doc preview</Link> example apply here.
- Advanced async parsers to convert complex source data into an array of `content`, `filename` compatible with `unified-doc`.
- `unified-doc-archive`
