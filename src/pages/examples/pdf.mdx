The PDF format is fundamentally incompatible with HTML.  This example converts PDF documents to HTML documents, represented by images and text nodes using [`pdf.js`][pdfjs].

With the HTML representation of a PDF document, we are now able to benefit from `unified-doc` APIs (e.g. render, search, export, marks).
