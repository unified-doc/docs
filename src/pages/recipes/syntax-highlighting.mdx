Syntax highlighting of code blocks is easily accomplished through the use of relevant [rehype][] plugins that are explored in the sections below.

### `rehype-highlight`
Syntax highlighting is done through the [`rehype-highlight`][rehype-highlight] plugin, which uses [`highlight.js`][highlightjs] under the hood.

Please refer to the plugin documentation for more advanced plugin configuration.


### `rehype-prism`
Syntax highlighting is done through the [`rehype-prism`][rehype-prism] plugin, which uses [`prism.js`][prismjs] under the hood.

Please refer to the plugin documentation for more advanced plugin configuration.


### Highlighting `.html`, `.md` files as source code

By default, `unified-doc` will auto-assign parsers based on inferred mime-type from the `filename`.  This means that parsers supporting various content types (e.g. `.html`, `.md`) will not render its contents as source code in a code block.  If you would like to explicitly render the content into a code block, set the `asCode` option to `true`.
