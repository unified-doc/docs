# eBook

This demo shows how we can easily manage bookmarks for a document in a controlled manner.  You can create a bookmark by selecting text in the document.  You can remove bookmarks by clicking on the annotations in the document or use the sidebar.  Clicking on a bookmark will navigate to the matched annotation in the document (simple anchorlink implementation).  Upon navigating to the matched annotation, we briefly highlight the matched line visually using the `highlight()` DOM API method.

## Concepts
- Using the `highlight()` DOM API method.
- Using the `selectText()` DOM API method.
- Controlled management of annotations.
- Annotation callbacks.
- Creating anchorlinks using the `annotation.id` field.
