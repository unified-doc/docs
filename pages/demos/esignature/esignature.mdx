# eSignature

This demo shows how we can use `annotations` as a way to create placeholders for labels and signatures.  The sidebar renders inputs based on valid values for `annotations.data.type`.  Editing the input will transform the contents of the annotated `mark` elements.  When all fields are completed, you can download the modified document as a HTML file.

> **Note**: You can create more advanced user experiences by transforming annotated `mark` elements into interactive signature placeholders instead of using a sidebar with text inputs.

## Concepts
- Imperative transformation of annotated `mark` elements.
- Making use the `annotation.data` field.
- Customize `annotations` with CSS.
