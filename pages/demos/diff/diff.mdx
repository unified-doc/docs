# Diff

This demo uses the [`diff`][diff] package to diff the string contents of two files.  The diffed `content` and `annotations` are created while iterating through diffed parts.  We then simply render the diffed `content` and `annotations` with `unified-doc`.  Simple CSS is specified on the `annotations` to distinguish between added and removed parts.

> **Note**:  The example preloads HTML and markdown content for comparison.  It is visually clear in the preloaded example why markdown is an _awesome_ markup language that closely resembles and therefore interoperable with HTML.

## Concepts
- Dynamically creating `content` and `annotations`.
- Applying simple CSS to `annotations`.
