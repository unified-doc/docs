# Diff

Use the [`diff`][diff] package to diff the string contents of two files.  Construct the diffed `content` and keep track of `annotations` while iterating through diffed parts.  Render the diffed `content` with a `doc` instance and apply `annotations`.  Use simple CSS to indicate added or removed parts.

> **Note**:  The example preloads HTML and markdown content for comparison.  It is visually clear in the preloaded example why markdown is an _awesome_ markup language that closely resembles and therefore interoperable with HTML.
