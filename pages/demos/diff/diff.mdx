# Diff

This demo uses the [`diff`][diff] package to diff the string contents of two files.  The diffed `content` and `annotations` are created while iterating through diffed parts, and rendered with `unified-doc`.  Simple CSS is specified on the `annotations` to visually distinguish between added and removed parts.

> **Note**:  The example preloads HTML and markdown content for comparison.  It is visually clear how markdown closely resembles HTML, and is therefore an awesome markup language interoperable with HTML.

## Concepts
- Dynamically creating `content` and `annotations`.
- Styling `annotations` with CSS.
