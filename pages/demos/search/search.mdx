# Search

This demo uses the `doc.search()` API method to search within a document.  Search results are rendered in a sidebar as snippets, and are also applied as `annotations` in the document.  Clicking on a snippet will navigate to the matched annotation in the document (simple anchorlink implementation).  Upon navigating to the matched annotation, we briefly highlight the matched line visually using the `highlight()` DOM API method.

> **Note**: The default search algorithm attached to the `doc` uses the [`micromatch`][micromatch] package which implements convenient bash/wildcard matching.  Please refer to the package for details on customizing matching through configurable options.

## Concepts
- Using the `doc.search()` API method.
- Using the `highlight()` DOM API method.
- Using [`micromatch`][micromatch] features through configurable options.
- Rendering search result snippets.
- Applying search results as annotations.
- Creating anchorlinks using the `annotation.id` field.
